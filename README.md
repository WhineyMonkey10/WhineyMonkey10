- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @WhineyMonkey10 - An extremely bored developer
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java & C#.
- ðŸ“« I'm working on a new personal website for myself since my current one is uhh, not the nicest one ever.
- ðŸš¨ Most of my cool projects are currently private repos. Will probabaly stay that way until I decide to have them realeased to the public. Please DM me on Discord (or any other platform) if for some reason you'd like to take a look at some of those projects.



P.S:

If you came here looking for the code for GladosAI, that will come very soon :)
